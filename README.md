### Hi there! 😁

I'm Roger Fernando from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm a back-end developer, currently developing in **C#**, **Ruby** and **Python** and currently looking to develop myself as a programmer. I'm passionate about open source projects, so I try to create projects that can add to my career and to the community.

Would you like to find me?
